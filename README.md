<p>Based off the very magical [React SlingShot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) but with some customizations:

1. Removed Sass support
1. Added PostCSS support
1. Added CSS Modules support
1. Removed demo by default
1. Kept absolute minimum boilerplate to run app

Current steps to get up and running:

1. download
1. run `npm run setup`
1. run `npm run start`
1. Das it dawg
